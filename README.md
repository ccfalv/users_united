# users_united


During the adoptathon we acquired 10 users over the course of the two days, so we got a late start. We had some issues with updating NEAR library and then Facebook cut us off temporarily (go figure!), but we're all good now. 

User growth is intentionally transparent, so if you go to usersunited.org you'll see our daily, weekly and monthly growth numbers right there on the page.
